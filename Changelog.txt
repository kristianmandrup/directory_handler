 * Made initial solution for parsing YAML configuration file
 * Next: Implement the Runner 
  - should call Handler chain created after load 
  - Chain should try each handler and find best match
  - Then create signature file in the dir if good match found or go to next dir if no good match (See Design.txt)
  
 * Next II:
  - Create new runner to run through dirs and handle signature files found, fx moving the dir to another location and/or updating database of apps.
